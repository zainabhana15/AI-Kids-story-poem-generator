# AI-Kids-story-poem-generator
## Your task is to create a Python program that does the following:

>Ask for a theme or topic they'd like the poem/story to be about (e.g., "a magical forest," "a friendly dragon," "an adventure on the moon").

>(Optional) Ask for a specific element they want in image (e.g. boy, girl, school, park etc)

>Use the user's input to craft a prompt for the OpenAI API.

>Make a call to the OpenAI API (using the openai Python library) to generate a short poem or story suitable for kids based on the prompt.

>Ensure the generated text is age-appropriate, imaginative, and engaging.

>Craft a descriptive prompt for DALL-E based on the generated poem/story.

>Use the DALL-E API to generate an image that visually represents the text.

>Consider elements like style (e.g., "cartoon," "watercolor") and aspect ratio in your DALL-E prompt.

>Print the generated poem/story to the console.

>Display the generated image. You can use libraries like PIL (Pillow) or matplotlib to show the image within your Python environment or save it and open it in a separate window.

>Stream lit Application to take user input and give a pdf output of the poem/story
